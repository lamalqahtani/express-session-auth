# Description
It is a simple project to demonstrate how to use express-session to authenticate users using session and cookies in a simple way.


# Resources. 
I mainly focused on two resources, first is the express-session documentation at npm. Second, is a medium post written by Gohit Varanasi about express-session usage.

1. [NPM express-session] (https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-session)
